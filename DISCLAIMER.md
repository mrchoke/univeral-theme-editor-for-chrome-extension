This extension was developed for the purpose of customizing CSS for the ThaiJO system and OJS3 as a tool for journal editors under the ThaiJO system. However, the extension's capabilities are not limited to this use case and can be applied to any website that requires additional CSS customization and implementation.

This project is a collaborative effort between two organizations: **NECTEC** (National Electronics and Computer Technology Center), **NSTDA** (National Science and Technology Development Agency), and **TCI** (Thai-Journal Citation Index Centre), **ThaiJO** (Thai Journals Online). Together, we are working to enhance the quality of online journals in Thailand.
